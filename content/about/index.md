Hello, my name is Alex. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
I am a student of the Web Development career at the University of La Matanza.

I like to learn constantly, and that presented with challenges to find their possible solution in order to achieve the collective and project objective.

I'm creative person, with an affinity for teamwork and the exchange of knowledge to obtain mutual professional growth.

For these reasons, I am looking for a new panorama, a company that trusts in me, my potential and my desire to constantly learn in order to offer them all my dedication. And, in this way, insert myself in the IT sector, which is the field that I am passionate about

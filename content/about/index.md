Hi, my name is Alex. I'live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm a FullStack Developer with a preference for Frontend and Augmented Reality development. I also study Web and Application Development at the University of La Matanza.

I like to learn constantly, and that challenges are presented to me to find their possible solution in order to achieve the collective objective and the project.

I am a creative person, with an affinity for teamwork and the exchange of knowledge to obtain mutual professional growth.

That is why I am looking for a new adventure, a company that trusts me, my potential and my desire to constantly learn to offer them all my dedication.
